Use an Amazon CloudFront distribution to serve a static website

This getting started tutorial shows you how to perform the following tasks:

  1. Register a domain name, such as example.com.

  2. Create a certificate for your domain.

  3. Create two Amazon S3 buckets and configure one to host a website and the other one to redirect to the subdomain.

  4. Create a sample website and save the file in your S3 bucket.

  5. Create CloudFront distributions for both S3 buckets.

  6. Configure Amazon Route 53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distributions.
